          <h4>Synopsis</h4>
          <p>
            Book Description: Chiltern creates the most beautiful editions of the World’s finest literature.
            Your favourite classic titles in a way you have never seen them before; the tactile layers, fine details and beautiful colours of these remarkable 
            covers make these titles feel extra special and will look striking on any shelf.
            This book has a matching lined journal (sold separately). They make a great gift when paired together but are also just as beautiful on their own.
            Dorian Gray  is the subject of a full-length portrait in oil by Basil Hallward, an artist impressed and infatuated by Dorian's beauty; he believes 
            that Dorian's beauty is responsible for the new mood in his art as a painter. Through Basil, Dorian meets Lord Henry Wotton, and he soon is enthralled 
            by the aristocrat's hedonistic world view: that beauty and sensual fulfilment are the only things worth pursuing in life. Newly understanding that his 
            beauty will fade, Dorian expresses the desire to sell his soul, to ensure that the picture, rather than he, will age and fade. The wish is granted, 
            and Dorian pursues a libertine life of varied amoral experiences while staying young and beautiful; all the while, his portrait ages and records every sin.

              <strong>Review:</strong> Have re-read this multiple times now and with each time I get something new out of it. Great quality book for the price and will continue to purchase other Chiltern editions.
