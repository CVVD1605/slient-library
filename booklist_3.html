          <h4>Synopsis</h4>
          <p>
            From the bestselling author of The Other Boleyn Girl, Philippa Gregory, comes a wonderfully atmospheric 
            evocation of the court of Henry VIII and his final queens. The king will decide who will live and who will 
            die; he has the power of God now. 1539. Henry VIII must take his fourth wife and the dangerous prize is won by Anne of Cleves. 
            A German princess by birth, Anne is to be Henry’s pawn in the Protestant alliance against Rome, but the marriage falters from 
            the start. Henry finds nothing to admire in his new queen, setting himself against his advisors and nobles to pay court to young 
            Katherine Howard.The new queen begins to sense a trap closing around her. And Jane Boleyn, summoned to the inner circle once more 
            by her uncle the Duke of Norfolk, finds a fractious court haunted by the Boleyn legacy of death and deceit.Nothing is certain in 
            a kingdom ruled by an increasingly tyrannical king.

              <strong>Review:</strong> 
              'One of Gregory's great strengths as a novelist is her ability to take familiar historical figures and flesh them into living breathing 
              human beings. “The Constant Princess” is a worthy successor to her previous novels about the Tudors and deserves to be a bestseller.' Daily Express
